DAY 1:
2667. Create Hello World Function
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World".

Example 1:

Input: args = []
Output: "Hello World"

Explanation:
const f = createHelloWorld();
f(); // "Hello World"
The function returned by createHelloWorld should always return "Hello World".

DAY 2:
2620. Counter
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then
                   returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 10 
["call","call","call"]
Output: [10,11,12]

Explanation: 
counter() = 10 // The first time counter() is called, it returns n.
counter() = 11 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
counter() = 12 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.

DAY 3:
2704. To Be Or Not To Be
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.
--toBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values === each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error "Not Equal".
--notToBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values !== each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error "Equal".

Example 1:

Input: func = () => expect(5).toBe(5)
Output: {"value": true}
Explanation: 5 === 5 so this expression returns true.


DAY 4:
2665. Counter II
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.

Example 1:

Input: init = 5, calls = ["increment","reset","decrement"]
Output: [6,5,4]
Explanation:
const counter = createCounter(5);
counter.increment(); // 6
counter.reset(); // 5
counter.decrement(); // 4

DAY 5:
2635. Apply Transform Over Each Element in Array

Given an integer array arr and a mapping function fn, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.
The returned array should be created such that returnedArray[i] = fn(arr[i], i).
Please solve it without the built-in Array.map method.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function plusone(n) { return n + 1; }
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation:
const newArray = map(arr, plusone); // [2,3,4]
The function increases each value in the array by one. 

DAY 6:
2634. Filter Elements from Array

Given an integer array arr and a filtering function fn, return a filtered array filteredArr.

The fn function takes one or two arguments:

arr[i] - number from the arr
--i - index of arr[i]
--filteredArr should only contain the elements from the arr for which the expression fn(arr[i], i) evaluates to a --truthy value. A truthy value is a value where Boolean(value) returns true.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.filter method.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,10,20,30], fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:
const newArray = filter(arr, fn); // [20, 30]
The function filters out values that are not greater than 10

DAY 7:
2626. Array Reduce Transformation

Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value init, return the final result obtained by executing the fn function on each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.

This result is achieved through the following operations: val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of val is then returned.

If the length of the array is 0, the function should return init.

Please solve it without using the built-in Array.reduce method.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr; }
init = 0
Output: 10
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=0.
(0) + nums[0] = 1
(1) + nums[1] = 3
(3) + nums[2] = 6
(6) + nums[3] = 10
The final answer is 10.

Example 2:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr * curr; }
init = 100
Output: 130
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=100.
(100) + nums[0] * nums[0] = 101
(101) + nums[1] * nums[1] = 105
(105) + nums[2] * nums[2] = 114
(114) + nums[3] * nums[3] = 130
The final answer is 130.


DAY 8:
2629. Function Composition

Given an array of functions [f1, f2, f3, ..., fn], return a new function fn that is the function composition of the array of functions.
The function composition of [f(x), g(x), h(x)] is fn(x) = f(g(h(x))).
The function composition of an empty list of functions is the identity function f(x) = x.
You may assume each function in the array accepts one integer as input and returns one integer as output.

Example 1:

Input: functions = [x => x + 1, x => x * x, x => 2 * x], x = 4
Output: 65
Explanation:
Evaluating from right to left ...
Starting with x = 4.
2 * (4) = 8
(8) * (8) = 64
(64) + 1 = 65

Example 2:

Input: functions = [x => x+5], x = 20
Output: 25
Explanation:
Evaluating the only function present
20 + (5) = 25

Example 3:

Input: functions = [], x = 42
Output: 42
Explanation:
The composition of zero functions is the identity function


Day 9:
2703. Return Length of Arguments Passed

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a function argumentsLength that returns the count of arguments passed to it.
 
Example 1:

Input: args = [5]
Output: 1
Explanation:
argumentsLength(5); // 1

One value was passed to the function so it should return 1.
